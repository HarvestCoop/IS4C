Lib holds the PHP scripts containing
nothing but functions. It is simply an organizational
choice.

gui-base.php also only has functions, but is left at the root level
because it contains the main frameset the entire program runs
through.
Note: 18Aug2012 EL gui-base.php no longer exists, at or below root.
