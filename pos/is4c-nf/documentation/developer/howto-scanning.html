The UPC <a href="howto-parse.html">parser module</a> is currently
hard to trace through and should probably be more flexible. I think
it should [eventually] be modular in three ways: handle special
store-specific UPCs so they don't have to be hard-coded, allow 
discounts to be calculated differently by location, and allow
pricing methods to vary by location.
<hr />
<h3>Special UPCs</h3>
This collection of classes handles UPCs that aren't actually 
products. For example, at WFC I use UPC prefix "4" on barcoded
member cards and custom coupons; someone else may use the prefix
differently or just not need that code enabled. 
<p />
<i>Note: Special UPCs cannot exist in the products table or they
will be treated like normal items</i>
<p />
All Special UPC object should subclass SpecialUPC (lib/Scanning/SpecialUPC.php)
and implement two methods:
<ul>
<li>is_special(string upc) - return true is the module handles this upc, false
otherwise</li>
<li>handle(string upc, array json) - perform whatever operations the
upc should trigger. handle() should return a json array with the same
formatting as a parser object (<a href="howto-parse.html">Reference</a>).
The json argument passed in will have all the required fields; handle()
just needs to make updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
For used to at some point and was still hardcoded in)
<pre>
class WackyPLU extends SpecialUPC {

	function is_special($upc){
		if ($upc == "0000000008005")
			return true;
		return false;
	}
	
	function handle($upc,$json){
		global $IS4C_PATH;
		$json['main_frame'] = $IS4C_PATH.'gui-modules/memlist.php';
		return $json;
	}
}
</pre>
