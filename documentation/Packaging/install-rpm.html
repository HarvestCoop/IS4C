	<title>Install Guide: RPM</title>
</head>
<body>
This guide is for installing it-core from RPMs. These instructions
are based on Fedora, but should work on any Redhat-ish distro.
<p />
This mostly command-line references. Be not afraid. It's just more
concise and accurate than verbally describing graphic interfaces.
<p />
<h3>Step one</h3>
Install your OS. If your chosen distribution doesn't have good 
documentation for this step, choose a new distribution.
<h3>Step two</h3>
Install some required packages.
<pre>
$ su
# yum -y install httpd mysql-server php php-mysql php-xml php-pear php-ldap
</pre>
The first command, su, changes to the root user. You will be prompted for
root's password. The second command install a bunch of packages via 
Red Hat package manager, yum.
<h3>Step three</h3>
Download and install it-core. Your filenames may differ slightly, depending on
the version number.
<pre>
# rpm -Uvh it-core-0.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
# rpm -Uvh it-core-doc-0.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
# rpm -Uvh it-core-fannie-0.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
# rpm -Uvh it-core-is4c-nf-0.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
</pre>
These commands should be run as root. The base it-core package is always
required. The it-core-doc package is just documentation and thus always
optional. The it-core-fannie package contains the backend server; it-core-is4c-nf
contains the lane point of sale system. Neither is strictly required, but
omitting both wouldn't make much sense.
<h3>Step four</h3>
Start required services
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/mysqld start
# mysqladmin password
# /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
# /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
</pre>
The first command starts the mysql database. The second sets a root password. The
third command just restarts the database so the password change takes affect.
The fourth sets the database to automatically run on boot. Next is apache:
<pre>
# /etc/init.d/httpd start
# /sbin/chkconfig httpd on
</pre>
This one's simpler. Start the service, configure it to start on boot.
<h3>Step five</h3>
Open a browser and go to http://localhost/it-core/. You should see at least a
license as well as documentation, fannie, and/or is4c-nf folders depending
on what you installed.

<h3>Further ideas (Production environment)</h3>
<ul>
<li>You probably want a static IP address. Go to Applications =&gt; Other
=&gt; Network (if your menu is different, try running nm-connection-editor
from the command line). Pick the appropriate connection - wired is recommended
- and edit.</li>
<li>You probably want SSH access through the firewall. Go to Applications =&gt;
Other =&gt; Firewall (if your menu is different, try running system-config-firewall
from the command line). Scroll down services and check the box for SSH. If it's 
already checked, toggle it off then back on just to be sure. Hit Apply to save
the updated rules, then Reload to restart the firewall. Linux veterans
can find the firewall configuration file at /etc/sysconfig/iptables.
</li>
<li>VNC can be useful for remote debugging. Go to Applications =&gt;
Other =&gt; Remote Desktop (if your menu is different, try running
vino-preferences from the command line). Turn on sharing. Security options
are up to you. A password is recommended. Automatically accepting connections
is not recommended. Tunneling VNC through SSH is more secure.
</li>
