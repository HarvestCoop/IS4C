<p>
Tender reporting needs and conventions can vary pretty widely. If the included
reports don't meet your needs, you can create a custom one. Just create a class
that inherits from the TenderReport base class. Inside the class, define a static
method named <b>get</b>. This method should return a string containing what you'd
like to print. Functions in the ReceiptLib class are useful for text formatting
and positioning. Functions in the Database class are useful for consulting 
transaction data to determine what to print. The details are entirely up to you.

<pre>
class ExampleTenderReport extends TenderReport {
	public static function get(){
		return 'My report contents';
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
By convention, the file name should match the class name (i.e., the example would
be named ExampleTenderReport.php). If the file is in lib/ReceiptBuilding/TenderReports
<b>or</b> anywhere inside an enabled plugin, the custom tender report will be
listed as an option on the <i>Extras</i> tab of the configuration page.
