This document will guide you through some basic member related tasks.
If you're starting from scratch, these should go roughly in order.
<h2>Membership Types</h2>
Every transaction is associated with an account. Membership types
let you group accounts for reporting purposes as well as confer 
different benefits to different accounts.
<p />
Member Types are edited by choosing Adming =&gt; Member Management
from Fannie's left hand menu, then <i>Manage Member Types</i>.
Each membership type is given a description for reporting purposes.
The <i>member</i> column denotes whether the account type is actually
a member. Non-member account types are an option to provide sales
to the general public. Accounts may also be assigned a percentage
discount or marked as store staff.
<p />
Set up as many types as you need. Stores that only sell to members
will require at least one member type. Stores that sell to the 
general public will need at least one type marked member and
on non-member type.
<h2>Membership-related Settings</h2>
Fannie's configuration page (if you've been following this guide, probably
http://localhost/fannie/install/) exposes a couple of membership related 
options you can adjust if needed.
<p />
The first is <i>Names per membership</i>, near the top of the page. If more
than one person's name can be associated with a membership, increase this
option accordingly.
<p />
The other option is <i>Equity Department(s)</i>, near the bottom of the page.
If you want to track member equity via POS, you must define dedicated equity
departments. At minimum there must be one, but you may define multiple 
equity department if needed (e.g., to track voting &amp; non-voting shares
separately). Separate multiple departments however you like - spaces, commas,
whatever.
<p />
<h2>Importing Existing Memberships</h2>
Many stores already have members and re-entering them all by hand
is less than ideal. If you can export your data into some form of spreadsheet
and save it as a CSV, mass importing is a quicker option. Select
Admin =&gt; Member Management from Fannie's left hand menu, then
<i>Import Data</i>.
<p />
First, bring in <i>Names &amp; Numbers</i>. Your spreadsheet should contain
columns for member number, first name, and last name. If you've defined
membership types, you may also include a type column as well. It doesn't
matter what order the columns are in or if there are extra columns; you
can specify where the relevant data is during the import. If Fannie can't
upload data sheets, there will be a giant warning telling you which
directory needs write permissions.
<p />
Next, bring in <i>Contact Information</i>. Your spreadsheet must have
a column for member number, and may include any combination of the
following: street address, second line of street address, city,
state, zip code, phone number, alternate phone number, and email address.
Same flexibility applies with regard to column order and extra
columns.
<p />
<h2>Brief Detour: Equity Tracking</h2>
If you plan to track equity through POS, there's an implementation detail to be
aware of. Equity is stored as a list of equity-related transactions. At any given
time, a member's equity balance is the sum of all their equity purchases. Storing
equity this way provides a history that can be verified against transaction logs
in the event of a dispute as well as greater flexibility in coping with varying
equity requirements.
<p />
If you're opening a new store, you can just define a equity department (or more
than one) and be done. If you already have members though, you need to bring
their existing equity balances in as a starting point for POS.
<p />
<h2>Back to Importing Data</h2>
The last import option is <i>existing equity</i>. At minimum, your spreadsheet
should provide a member number and an equity amount. Optionally, you can
include a transaction identifier referencing your previous system, a IS4C
department number to distinguish a specific type of equity, or a date
(YYYY-MM-DD) of purchase. You don't have to bring in existing balances as
a lump sum; if it's useful for reporting purposes or enforcing member-equity
requirements, you can specify multiple rows per member (collectively these should
add up to the current balance).
